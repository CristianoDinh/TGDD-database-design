ðŸ”Ž For more information, visit [The Gioi Di Dong](https://www.thegioididong.com/) .

## Re-designing a website database using SQL Server(Microsoft). The project follows BNCF design principles and includes implementations of Views, Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers.
<!-- Step2: INTRO PARAGRAPH -->  
Below are the steps and key features implemented in this project:

* **Database Design**: Following BNCF principles to ensure a normalized and efficient database structure.
* **Implementation of Views**: Creating views to simplify complex queries and enhance data presentation.
* **Stored Procedures**: Developing stored procedures for modular and reusable database operations.
* **Functions**: Implementing user-defined functions to encapsulate reusable logic within the database.
* **Triggers**: Setting up triggers to automate and enforce business rules.

<!-- Step4: USER INSTRUCTIONS(Installation instruction for Users) -->  
## How to install this example SQL on Windows

The easiest way to see how this works is to watch the series, but here's the short version.

1. clone this project
2. Download [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads?msockid=099aa7460201689408a2b231030069c3)


<!-- Step5: DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS(Installation instruction for Developer) 
*How to build and install the application locally, but also how to work on it...this instructions is more about people that want to contribute the tool..usually different to the ones that you would give instruction to end user.*

Installation and usage instructions (for contributors) - Ya know the best part of open source projects? If you make something really cool, others will want to help make it better! In this section of the README, give instructions on how to pull the code down and start up the tool for development purposes. This section is usually pretty technical and may require instruction on how to build from source, but hopefully, you have a script for MAKEFILE from stuff like that. Anything you can do to make the development experience easier will help you gain more contributors.
